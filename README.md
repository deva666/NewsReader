Code that follows Packt Publishing [Kotlin in Practice](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kotlin-practice-video) Video Course 

Example of Kotlin Coroutine usage, with Realm and Retrofit.

Most of the code in the Master branch is by now out of date. For example, Kotlin Coroutines are now stable and have a slightly different API.
The master branch is not updated, because it follows the code from the course.

[Kotlin_1.3 Branch](https://github.com/deva666/NewsReader/tree/kotlin_1.3) is updated to Kotlin 1.3 and Coroutines 1.0.

There is also a [RxJava](https://github.com/deva666/NewsReader/tree/RxJava) branch that uses RxJava for Async and Reactive programming.

To make the project compile, you need to get an API key from [NewsApi.org](https://newsapi.org/) and put it into your local `gradle.properties` file under the key `NEWS_READER_API_KEY`
